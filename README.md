**Project Objective:**

The goal of the project is to support efficient management of water quality by considering feature importance analysis, unequal datasets, and ethical issues. The connection of data science and public health offers the opportunity for proactive solutions and enhanced decision-making in ensuring safe drinking water for communities globally, as access to clean water continues to be a global challenge.  

**Features:**

**Data Collection:** The process of collecting information from multiple sources for certain uses like analysis, research, or decision-making is known as data collection. 

**Data Exploration:** Analyzing the fundamental structure of the data, detecting patterns, identifying patterns, and developing hypothesis for further investigation are the main objectives of data exploration.

**Data Processing:** Data preprocessing aims to clean the data and make it suitable for input into machine learning algorithms. This includes tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing features. 

**Data Visualization:** It is a crucial component of the project pipeline. Visualizations can include plots, charts, heatmaps, graphs, and maps that highlight relationships between variables, spatial patterns, and trends over time.

**Data Analysis:** Advanced analytical techniques are applied to extract meaningful information from the data. Feature selection may also be performed to identify the most relevant variables for predicting water potability.

This is our project pipeline.
